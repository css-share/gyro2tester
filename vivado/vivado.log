CRITICAL WARNING: [BD 41-1761] Reset pin '/BiDirChannels_0/tx_rstn' is found to be associated with multiple clock pins, which are not compatible w.r.t frequency, phase and clock-domain. This may prevent design from functioning correctly. Please ensure same reset pin is either not associated with different clock pins or all associated clock pins are driven by same or compatible clock source(s). List of associated clock pins:
/BiDirChannels_0/txclk
/BiDirChannels_0/MCK_P
/BiDirChannels_0/MCK_N
/BiDirChannels_0/SYNCK
