WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net design_2_i/BiDirChannels_0/inst/u_gyro_serialout/CLK_DIV_CNTR/mux_out is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_2_i/BiDirChannels_0/inst/u_gyro_serialout/CLK_DIV_CNTR/Q_reg_i_2/O, cell design_2_i/BiDirChannels_0/inst/u_gyro_serialout/CLK_DIV_CNTR/Q_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
