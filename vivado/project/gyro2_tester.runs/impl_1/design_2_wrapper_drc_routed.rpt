CHECK-3#1 Warning
Report rule limit reached  
REQP-1839 rule limit reached: 20 violations have been found.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_2_i/BiDirChannels_0/inst/u_gyro_serialout/CLK_DIV_CNTR/mux_out is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_2_i/BiDirChannels_0/inst/u_gyro_serialout/CLK_DIV_CNTR/Q_reg_i_2/O, cell design_2_i/BiDirChannels_0/inst/u_gyro_serialout/CLK_DIV_CNTR/Q_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 design_2_i/RxFIFO/inst/u_rx_async_stream_fifo/rgfile_reg_0_0 has an input control pin design_2_i/RxFIFO/inst/u_rx_async_stream_fifo/rgfile_reg_0_0/ADDRARDADDR[0] (net: design_2_i/RxFIFO/inst/u_rx_async_stream_fifo/w_bnext_q_reg[0]_rep_n_0) which is driven by a register (design_2_i/RxFIFO/inst/u_rx_async_stream_fifo/w_bnext_q_reg[0]_rep) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>
