TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock design_2_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin design_2_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) SPI_D direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (SPI_D) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-2#1 Warning
Port pin INOUT inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) design_2_i/SPI_D direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (SPI_D_OBUF) connected to this hierarchical pin/port, but both were not found.
